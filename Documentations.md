# All documentation of Dust package

## I- Introduction 

  ### A- What is Dust ?

The dust is any solid particle in the air that is under 500 micrometers in diameter. 
The dust is defined into three categories: 
Domestic dust (or house dust): all dust you found in our homes, businesses and all other building interior. 
Atmospheric dust: he greater atmosphere of the Earth, natural as well as man-made
Cosmic dust: dust that you can found in outer space-think 

  ### B- Why we choose this project ?

We saw that a chinese artist (named Nut Brother) collects dust to make some bricks with this dust. The project of this man interest us that’s why we decide to make the same kind of project. 

 ### C- First idea of the project 

Before to begin the prototype we thought about another project. We thought about a way to attract the dust which fall on the floor into a box. But we thought that we will don’t have enough to finish this kind of project that’s why we choose to collect dust particles in the air. 

## II- Project: Dust Package

The aim of the project is to collect the dust particles from the air to reduce air pollution.

  ### A- 1st test with static electricity 

After researches and experiments, we find that using static electricity is a good way to catch the dust (like Swiffer or Mocoro). Then, we decided to go on to find possibilities.

   #### A.1- Explication of the experience 
We take plexiglass and we scrub it to make static electricity. Then we put the plexiglass load in static electricity in front of dust. Thanks to this, we see that we capture the dust on the plexiglass. 
We have to record with an USB microscope, the dust on the plexiglass.

  #### A.2- Result
So now, we can say that the dust can be capture with static electricity. 

After this little experience, we have to create a prototype. 
We think about 2 prototypes: 1 is manually and 1 is automatic. Here, we will create the prototype which manually. 

## III- The prototype 
  ### A- Characteristic


## IV- Test of the prototype

### A-Creation of the prototype
We will create a box with plexiglass. Then we will connect a manually fan (fan computer’s) for the air.

### B- Explication of the prototype 
The prototype is simple. You have to load the plexiglass in static electricity manually. After, you have to launch the fan manually too. After these steps, the air will enter in the box and you will see the dust on the plexiglass because it load in static electricity. (put a photo of the prototype maybe)

 ### C- Result 
When the prototype is created, we have to record with an USB microscope, the dust on the plexiglass.

## V- The future of the project 

We need to think about the future (I think about the automatic project) that’s to say we have to develop several parts: the cost of the automatic project/prototype ? How long will this project take?
